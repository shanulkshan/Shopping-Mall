# üñºÔ∏è Logo/Image Display Fix

## What Was Wrong:
- Vercel serverless functions don't serve static files like a traditional Express server
- Images uploaded to `/uploads/shop-logos/` weren't accessible via direct URLs
- The image URL handling wasn't properly configured for production

## What I Fixed:

### 1. **Image Serving Endpoint**
- Added `/uploads/shop-logos/:filename` API endpoint in server
- This serves images through the Express server instead of static file serving
- Added proper cache headers for performance

### 2. **Image URL Handling**
- Updated `src/utils/imageUtils.js` to handle production vs development URLs correctly
- In development: `http://localhost:3000/uploads/shop-logos/filename.jpg`
- In production: `/uploads/shop-logos/filename.jpg` (relative URL)

### 3. **Vercel Configuration**
- Updated `vercel.json` to route `/uploads/*` requests to the server
- This ensures image requests go through the Express server

## How to Test:

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Visit your app**: https://shopping-mall-dun.vercel.app
3. **Test image display**:
   - Check if shop logos appear
   - Look for any shop cards with images
   - Check browser Network tab for image requests

## Debug Image Issues:

### Test Direct Image Access:
Visit: `https://shopping-mall-dun.vercel.app/uploads/shop-logos/shopLogo-1752060348811-77044781.jpg`

**Expected**: Image should display or download
**If 404**: Image serving endpoint not working

### Check Network Tab:
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Look for image requests
4. Check if they return 200 OK or error codes

### Common Issues:
- **404 errors**: Image files not included in deployment
- **500 errors**: Server error in image serving endpoint
- **CORS errors**: Image requests blocked by CORS policy

## If Images Still Don't Work:

### Option 1: Check Uploaded Images
The current uploaded image is: `shopLogo-1752060348811-77044781.jpg`
Test URL: https://shopping-mall-dun.vercel.app/uploads/shop-logos/shopLogo-1752060348811-77044781.jpg

### Option 2: Force Default Images
If uploaded images don't work, the app will fall back to default SVG logos (base64 encoded)

### Option 3: Use Base64 Storage
Consider storing images as base64 in the database instead of file uploads for better Vercel compatibility
