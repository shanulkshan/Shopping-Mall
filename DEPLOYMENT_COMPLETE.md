# 🎉 Serendib Plaza - Deployment Complete!

## ✅ **Everything is Now Working!**

### **What We Fixed:**

1. **🔧 Backend Connectivity**
   - Fixed all hardcoded `localhost:3000` API URLs
   - Updated CORS to allow your Vercel domain
   - Fixed environment variables setup

2. **🖼️ Image/Logo Display**
   - Fixed image serving for uploaded shop logos
   - Updated Vercel configuration to serve static assets
   - Browser tab icon now shows `logo2.png`

3. **🏢 Complete Rebranding**
   - Application name: **"Serendib Plaza"**
   - Favicon: `logo2.png`
   - Navbar logo: `logo2.png`
   - Updated all user-facing text

4. **🛠️ Technical Improvements**
   - Added debugging for authentication issues
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Improved SEO with meta tags

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Frontend**: Loading perfectly
- ✅ **Backend**: API working (login, auth, data)
- ✅ **Images**: Logos and uploaded images displaying
- ✅ **Branding**: Complete "Serendib Plaza" rebrand
- ✅ **Favicon**: Browser tab shows logo2.png

### **About the Console Error:**
The CSP error you see is from a **browser extension**, not your app:
```
tab.js:1 Refused to execute inline script because it violates CSP...
```
This is harmless and doesn't affect your application functionality.

### **Final App URL:**
🌐 **https://shopping-mall-dun.vercel.app**

### **Features Working:**
- ✅ User registration/login
- ✅ Shop browsing and management
- ✅ Admin dashboard
